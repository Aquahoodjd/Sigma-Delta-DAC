# Sigma-Delta-DAC
This repository hosts the development of a sigma-delta digital-to-analog converter (DAC) implementation on FPGA, integrated with a pipeline prototype of digital signal processing (DSP) from GNU Radio. 

The S-D DACs uses less analog circuitry at the expense of more digital circuitry compared to the Nyquist rate DACs. This is done using the concepts of oversampling and noise shaping.
The figure below shows a block diagram of a S-D DAC.
